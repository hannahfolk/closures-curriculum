## The Problem
Create a nested function that reverses a string.

### Instructions

* Inside `script.js`, write a function that creates a variable called `str` and set it to any string you like.
* Inside of this function, write a function that reverses `str`. You may use any array and string methods that you see fit. You may have to do some research on array methods and string methods. Try your best! Remember that you can also look at past activities for help.
* Console log the reversed string inside the inner function.
* Call your inner function in the proper place (be careful about scope here!).
* Call your outer function.

* When finished with the above steps, open your `index.html` file in the browser.
* Navigate to the console in the dev tools to see if your console log worked.
