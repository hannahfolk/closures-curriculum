## The Problem
Write and execute a closure that returns the index of an element in an array given an array. This will be somewhat emulating the `indexOf` array method.

### Instructions

* Inside `script.js`, create an outer function that takes in an array.
* Inside the outer function, create a function that takes in a target element.
* Inside the inner function, find the index of this target element relative to the outer function's array. Return the index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.
* Inside the outer function, return the inner function.
* Create a closure by calling the outer function and setting it to a variable.
* Call that variable and feed in a target element.

* When finished with the above steps, open your `index.html` file in the browser.
* Navigate to the console in the dev tools to see if your console log worked.
